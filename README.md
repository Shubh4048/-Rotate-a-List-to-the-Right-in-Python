# -Rotate-a-List-to-the-Right-in-Python
This Python program rotates a list to the right by one position. The last element of the list is moved to the front, while the remaining elements shift one step to the right.

🧠 How It Works:
If the list has 0 or 1 element, it is returned unchanged.
Otherwise:
   lst[-1] gets the last element
   lst[:-1] gets all elements except the last
   Both parts are combined to form the rotated list

✅ Use Cases:
   Array manipulation problems
   Circular data structures   
   Interview practice (lists & slicing)
